# Tunes

Welcome to the Tunes repository! This is a central hub for the Gitar engineering team to share useful code snippets and other helpful resources with each other and the wider community.

## Purpose

As our codebase and team grow, we often find ourselves solving similar problems or developing reusable patterns across different projects. This repository serves as a way for us to consolidate and share that knowledge, making it easier for everyone to learn from each other's experiences and avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the wider community! If you have a code snippet or anything else that you think would be valuable to share, please feel free to open a pull request.

When contributing, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

* Include a clear description of what your code does and why it's useful
* If you're adding a new directory, update the README in that directory to provide an overview of its contents

## Join the Discussion

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us directly in our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gitarcommunity/shared_invite/zt-2ghh6dprb-uGNBw3nSljjQpjiqBV_c8A)! We appreciate any input that can help make this repository more valuable for the community.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tunes!
